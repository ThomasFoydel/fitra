        facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your
        personal information (see "WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?"
        above), in United States, and other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these
        countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar
        laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all
        necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance
        with this privacy notice and applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</p>
      <p>
        We have implemented measures to protect your personal information,
        including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual
        Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group
        companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses
        require all recipients to protect all personal information that they
        process originating from the EEA in accordance with European data
        protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be
        provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate
        safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and
        further details can be provided upon request.
      </p>
      <h3>8. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short: </strong> We are not responsible for the safety of any
        information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but
        are not affiliated with, our Website.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Website may contain advertisements from third parties that are not
        affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services
        or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of
        data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third
        parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible
        for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any
        third parties, including other websites, services or applications that
        may be linked to or from the Website. You should review the policies of
        such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your
        questions.
      </p>
      <h3>9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short: </strong> We keep your information for as long as
        necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
        otherwise required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <h3>10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short: </strong> We aim to protect your personal information
        through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
        access the Website within a secure environment.

      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
        years of age. By using the Website, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Website. If we learn that personal

        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
        may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at

        If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
        you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note
        however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
        before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your
        personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds
        other than consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we
        are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
        right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

        <u>Verification process</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. If, however, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.
